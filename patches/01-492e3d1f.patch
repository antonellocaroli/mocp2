    ALSA: Use fixed percentage scale for volume manipulation.
    
    This fixes a drift in displayed volume percentage after it has been
    increased and decreased several times or MOC is stopped and restarted
    where the displayed volume does not return to its original value.
    
    It interoperates consistantly with mplayer, but other players have
    not been tested.
